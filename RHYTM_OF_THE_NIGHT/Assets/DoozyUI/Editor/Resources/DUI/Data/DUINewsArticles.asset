  - title: TouchManager & GestureDetector
    content: 'DoozyUI 2.9 comes with a new module, the TouchManager, that gets created
      automatically when needed, or manually on demand. This manager handles the capture
      of the following gestures: tap, long tap and swipes (on 4 or 8 axis).


      In order to capture and react to a gesture there is a new GestureDetector component
      that can be attached to anything that needs to react to gestures (2D and 3D
      objects).


      This gesture detection implementation is still in its early stages of development
      as we are working on adding more options to it. Should you have any suggestions
      for the TouchManager or the GestureDetector, please let us know.'
